# Bug Tracker application

### **ðŸ‘·Work in progressðŸ‘·**

This is a simple Bug Tracker/Feature request application created using Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. Using this application users will be able to create, close, edit, review, work on tickets. There are 4 types of users: Admin, Project Manager, Developer and Submitter, each has its unique permissions and features that they could use.

The plan is to add more features as I develop this application.

Before this project, I haven't done anything with Java, so I decided to expand my knowledge by creating this project.
